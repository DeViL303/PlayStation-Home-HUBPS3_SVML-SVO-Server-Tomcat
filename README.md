# PlayStation_Home_HUBPS3_SVML_SVO_Server_for-Tomcat

Recreated SVO server as a Tomcat java based webapp, Something like it probably was originally. 

This is very basic, proof of concept only. This is enough to get older version of PS Home like 1.32.3 HDK into online mode when used with Horizon from Multiserver for muis/mas/dme etc. 

Credits go mostly to the developers of the original SVO server in Horizon and to the developers of Multiserver - This is based on their work.
